  "summary": "The diff implements most of the mobile-first conversion requirements. REQ-10, REQ-11, REQ-12, REQ-13, and REQ-14 are all substantially addressed. However, one specific acceptance criterion for REQ-13 (swipe-down to dismiss the comments panel) appears unimplemented — only backdrop tap dismissal is present. Everything else aligns well with the build request.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "The comments panel can be dismissed by swiping down (in addition to tapping the backdrop).",
      "reason": "The CommentsPanel implementation shows backdrop tap dismissal via onClick={onClose} and a static drag handle div, but there is no touch event handling (onTouchStart/onTouchMove/onTouchEnd) or swipe-down gesture logic to actually dismiss the panel by dragging it down.",
